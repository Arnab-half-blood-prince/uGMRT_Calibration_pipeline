The direction-dependent calibration is challenging for wide-bandwidth data set of uGMRT.
I have tried for a single data set to peel the problematic sources with direction dependent calibration solution for wide band data.
I will add the procedure here. I used DDFacet, Cubical and wsclean to model these problematic sources and to solve the DD-calibration effects. For the improvemnts 
after the DD calibration of 550-950 MHz observation with uGMRT please check the uploaded gif. Note that this is a mosaic of three pointings and I do the mosaic of each pointing 
by stitching them together linearly with MONTAGE. 
However, this is not a straight forward way and may not apply to other data sets.
Currently, I am working on uGMRT observations at other bands.
This is a unfinished business and to be added soon.
