The direction-dependent calibration is challenging for wide-bandwidth data set of uGMRT.
I have tried for a single data set to peel the problematic sources with direction dependent calibration solution for wide band data.
I will add the procedure here.
However, this is not straight forward and may not apply to other data sets.
Also, it is not tested for different bands data sets as of now. 
This is a unfinished business and to be added soon.
