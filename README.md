# uGMRT_Calibration_pipeline
A  calibration, imaging  pipeline for uGMRT data
The pipeline contains a direction independent calibration pipeline tool. 
This is mainly designed for direction-independent calibration of uGMRT data set. 
I have tested this to Band 3 (250 - 500 MHz), Band 4 (550-850 MHz) and Band 5 (1050-1450 MHz) uGMRT data.

The relevant images for different data sets are also uploaded in the test folder. 
If everything works well you should expect a calibration output like these as give in the test folder.

If you use it and find any problem kindly let me know. 
Any suggestions regarding improvements of the pipeline is welcome.
